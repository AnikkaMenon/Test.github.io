	 <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am Anikka. I am 11 years old. I study in Lilavatibai Podar School. My favourite colour is rose gold. I love to travel around the world. I like art and craft. I also love reading. I love playing online games such as Roblox. I also have a youtube channel by the name of "Anikka Menon".When I was a beginner i used to draw mountains and a river and a house. I used to colour it with crayons but as time passed I was introduced to new art supplies like a brush, a pallete,.I also loved painting different elements of nature. Do check out my Art tab where I have put pictures of my artworks!. I have loved visiting new places but I didn't like the winding roads of mountains, travelling in cars,buses etc. I have visited many places such as Delhi,Kerala,Goa,Punjab, Rajasthan etc. I have also visited some tourist attractions such as Taj Mahal, Amer Fort,Ooty etc. I had also visite London. I had seen the Cadbury World, The London Eye , Big Ben,Peppa Pig's World and Harry Potter Studio. Do check out the my travel book to see some awesome pictures of these destinations.
